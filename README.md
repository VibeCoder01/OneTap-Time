## Key Features

- **Simple Timer:** Start and stop tracking with a single click. The timer displays the elapsed time in a clear, easy-to-read format.
- **Activity Naming:** Name your activities as you track them for clear record-keeping.
- **Customizable Categories:** Organize your activities into categories. Each category can have a unique name, color, and a wide selection of icons to choose from.
- **Detailed Activity Log:** View a chronological list of all your tracked activities. You can easily edit or delete entries directly from the log.
- **Today's Summary:** A visual summary of your day's activities, complete with a pie chart to show how your time was distributed across different categories.
- **Data Portability:** Export all your activities and categories to a JSON file for backup, or import them back into the app at any time.
- **Collapsible UI:** All sections except the main timer are collapsible, allowing you to maintain a clean and focused workspace.

## Data Persistence

Your data is automatically saved to your browser's local storage. This means all your activities, categories, and even a running timer are preserved between sessions. You can close your browser and come back later to find everything exactly as you left it.

## How to Use

1.  **Start Tracking:** Simply press the "Start Timer" button to begin a new activity.
2.  **Name Your Activity:** While the timer is running, you can enter a name for your activity in the input field.
3.  **Select a Category:** Choose a category from the dropdown menu.
4.  **Manage Categories:** Use the "Manage Categories" section to add, edit, or delete categories to suit your needs.
5.  **Stop Tracking:** When you're finished, click the "Stop Timer" button. The activity will be automatically saved to your log.
6.  **Review Your Day:** Expand the "Activity Log" to see past entries or "Today's Summary" to get a visual breakdown of your time.
